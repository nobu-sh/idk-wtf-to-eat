Uses geo location and google api to scrape restaurants near you and puts them on a spin wheel.

Currently limited to 20 restaurants near you, might be less duplicates are removed.
Waiting on https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/314796720 so we can paginate more results.

(who thought it would be a good idea to limit the results to 20 over all??? Makes the api useless for like 90% of the use cases 🤦‍♀️)
